Formally; the main difference between them consists of a nonlinear normalization step inherent in RadViz. In this paper we show that; although RadViz can be useful when analyzing sparse data; in general this design choice limits its applicability and introduces several drawbacks for exploratory data analysis. In particular; we observe that the normalization step introduces nonlinear distortions; can encumber outlier detection; prevents associating the plots with useful linear mappings; and impedes estimating original data attributes accurately. In addition; users have greater flexibility when choosing different layouts and views of the data in star coordinates. Therefore; we suggest that analysts and researchers should carefully consider whether RadViz's normalization step is beneficial regarding the data sets' characteristics and analysis tasks.", keywords: "RadViz;Star coordinates;Exploratory data analysis;Cluster analysis;Classification;", betweeness: 306, closeness: 54,group: 0},{ name:"Axis Calibration for Improving Data Attribute Estimation in Star Coordinates Plots", author: "Rubio-Sanchez; M.;Sanchez; A.", year: "2014", conference: "InfoVis", link: "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346258", abstract: "Star coordinates is a well-known multivariate visualization method that produces linear dimensionality reduction mappings through a set of radial axes defined by vectors in an observable space. One of its main drawbacks concerns the difficulty to recover attributes of data samples accurately; which typically lie in the [0]; [1] interval; given the locations of the low-dimensional embeddings and the vectors. In this paper we show that centering the data can considerably increase attribute estimation accuracy; where data values can be read off approximately by projecting embedded points onto calibrated (i.e.; labeled) axes; similarly to classical statistical biplots. In addition; this idea can be coupled with a recently developed orthonormalization process on the axis vectors that prevents unnecessary distortions.

Up to now; however; their use is mostly limited to tomographic imaging modalities such as CT or MRI. With very few exceptions; such as fetal ultrasound; classic volume rendering using one-dimensional intensity-based transfer functions fails to yield satisfying results in case of ultrasound volumes. This is particularly due its gradient-like nature; a high amount of noise and speckle; and the fact that individual tissue types are rather characterized by a similar texture than by similar intensity values. Therefore; clinicians still prefer to look at 2D slices extracted from the ultrasound volume. In this work; we present an entirely novel approach to the classification and compositing stage of the volume rendering pipeline; specifically designed for use with ultrasonic images. We introduce point predicates as a generic formulation for integrating the evaluation of not only low-level information like local intensity or gradient; but also of high-level information; such as non-local image features or even anatomical models. Thus; we can successfully filter clinically relevant from non-relevant information. In order to effectively reduce the potentially high dimensionality of the predicate configuration space; we propose the predicate histogram as an intuitive user interface. This is augmented by a scribble technique to provide a comfortable metaphor for selecting predicates of interest. Assigning importance factors to the predicates allows for focus-and-context visualization that ensures to always show important (focus) regions of the data while maintaining as much context information as possible.

One such example is pockets of gas which; if found inside the body at abnormal locations; are a crucial part of a diagnostic visualization. This paper presents an approach that enhances DVR transfer function design with spatial localization based on user specified material dependencies. Semantic expressions are used to define conditions based on relations between different materials; such as only render iodine uptake when close to liver. The underlying methods rely on estimations of material distributions which are acquired by weighing local neighborhoods of the data against approximations of material likelihood functions. This information is encoded and used to influence rendering according to the user's specifications. The result is improved focus on important features by allowing the user to suppress spatially less-important data. In line with requirements from actual clinical DVR practice; the methods do not require explicit material segmentation that would be impossible or prohibitively time-consuming to achieve in most real cases. The scheme scales well to higher dimensions which accounts for multi-dimensional transfer functions and multivariate data.

A residue flow model based on Darcy's law is employed to control distributions of opacity between branches of the contour tree. Topological attributes are also used to control color selection in a perceptual color space and create harmonic color transfer functions. The generated transfer functions can depict inclusion relationship between structures and maximize opacity and color differences between them.

A central element of volume rendering is the conversion between data values and observable quantities such as color and opacity. This process is usually realized through the use of transfer functions that are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. For multidimensional transfer functions applied to multivariate data; these lookup tables become prohibitively large. We propose the direct evaluation of a particular type of transfer functions based on a sum of Gaussians. Because of their simple form (in terms of number of parameters); these functions and their analytic integrals along line segments can be evaluated efficiently on current graphics hardware; obviating the need for precomputed lookup tables. We have adopted these transfer functions because they are well suited for classification based on a unique combination of multiple data values that localize features in the transfer function domain.

However; this does not remove the problem for two reasons: 1) there are data sets for which even the individual segments are too large for the largest graphics workstations; 2) many practitioners do not have access to workstations with the memory capacity required to load even a segment; especially since the state-of-the-art visualization tools tend to be developed by researchers with much more powerful machines. When the size of the data that must be accessed is larger than the size of memory; some form of virtual memory is simply required. This may be by segmentation; paging; or by paged segments.

More precisely; the compression scheme consists of a newly developed pipeline starting from an initial B-spline wavelet precoding. The fundamental properties of wavelets allow progressive transmission and interactive control of the compression gain by means of global and local oracles. In particular the authors discuss the problem of oracles in semiorthogonal settings and propose sophisticated oracles to remove unimportant coefficients.

Second; although greyscale images are the normal method for displaying medical volumes; these types of images are not necessarily appropriate for highlighting regions of interest within the volume. Studies of the human visual system have shown that individual intensity values are difficult to detect in a greyscale image. In these situations colour is a more effective visual feature.

LISTEN is an object-oriented system that is modular; flexible; adaptable; portable; interactive and extensible. We demonstrate that sonification is very effective as an additional tool in visualizing geometric and fluid flow uncertainty.", keywords: "flow;geometry;interactive;interpolation;MIDI;modular;portable;sonification;uncertainty;", betweeness: 6, closeness: 25,group: 34},{ name:"Real-time incremental visualization of dynamic ultrasound volumes using parallel BSP trees", author: "Garrett; W.F.;Fuchs; H.;Whitton; M.C.;State; A.", year: "1996", conference: "Vis", link: "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1996.568114", abstract: "We present a method for producing real-time volume visualizations of continuously captured; arbitrarily-oriented 2D arrays (slices) of data.

We use binary space partition (BSP) tree data structures to provide non-intersecting; visibility-ordered primitives for accurate opacity accumulation images. New in our system is a method of using parallel; time-shifted BSP trees to efficiently manage the continuously captured ultrasound data and to decrease the variability in image generation time between output frames.

The article presents UFLOW-a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data; in this work; we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs; flow envelopes; animations; priority sequences; twirling batons of trace viewpoints; and rakes.

Based on the asymptotic decay of multiscale representations of spatially localized time evolutions of the data; singular points can be discriminated. Also; the corresponding Lipschitz exponents; which describe the signals' local regularity; can be determined; and can be taken as a measure of the variation in time.

Further; Cortex supports high-performance by running on massively parallel computers and workstation clusters. An important goal for Cortex; is to provide visualization to a variety of solvers which differ in their solution methodologies and supported flow models. Coupled with the co-processing requirement; this has required the development of a well defined programming interface to the CFD solver that lets the visualization system communicate efficiently with the solver; and requires minimal programming effort for porting to new solvers. Further; the requirement for targeting multiple solvers and application niches demands that the visualization system be rapidly and easily modifiable.
